# CS230-OperatingPlatforms-Design-Document

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client is attempting to expand their current gaming app to other clients outside of the Android world. This should be a web based game and the game there can be multiple instances of the game at one time with unique players playing together at a time. Using these requirements we are looking at the different type of architecture types there are for operating systems as well as looking at design patterns. In this case, we would be using a singleton pattern and look at specifically client - server structures. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Although some of the concepts were not very clear to me at times, I was able to convey clear and concise information regarding the items I felt more comfortable and confident about. I like these kind of documents because you can go right to the point more like science papers where they are very factual rather than focusing on "elegant" writing. I also felt confident in my ability to pass along the information but filtering out the technical jargon that some clients may not understand. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I appreciated that the design document acted as a template in trying to understand the intent of the client and really understand the needs and how that will translate to code. It empasizes the importance of meeting with the clients before hand and asking questions when clarity is needed to be more efficient. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I struggled the most with the architecture portion. When looking at the books and some of the words describing these in the class documents, I felt like they were not really consistent and I had a hard time figuring out which were which. This was probably my weakest portion of the design document as I know that I want to go for a serverless architecture but in terms of actually explaining that, I'm not sure if I had to go into more detail of what the structure would be like at the level of the cloud host. It was very difficult matching the reading to the assignments this time around. I felt myself searching lots of online questions in order to help with this. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I answered this question earlier but it is worth re-emphasizing that the user and their needs are of the most important information needed for designing software. In order to truly create the most efficient software we can, we need to know the needs of the user. I will also state in here that the most efficient software created may change as the users needs may change as well. During the design process, it's often common that the user may have an idea of their needs but there are items that go missed sometimes with certain unknowns or changes in the business that effect the software design process as a whole. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
For the purposes of this class, we were designing software in such a way that included the following steps: 
1-Check the Requirements as set by the client
2-Check for Design Constraints based on the requirements
3-Evaluate the Domain Model
4-Evaluate different Operating Systems for the Server Side
5-Evaluate Storage/Memory Needs
6-Evaluate how the software will be distributed and what connections will be used
7-Evaluate the Security of the software and what other areas can be made more secure
All of these items are the items that will need to be looked at very closely during the design process and provides a great template in order to do that for future projects. As my skills as a software developer become stronger, I believe there are variations to evaluating these different items that may flow easier and sometimes working on specific ones may be easier if the client already has an idea what direction they want to go with some of these.
